      <p>Scott is a currently working at Liberty Mutual as an Information Security Analyst. He studied Cyber Security at Penn State University and graduated in May 2015. His interests include sports, fantasy football, snowboarding, information technology, and cooking.</p>

      <p>He is taking the UNH coding bootcamp to gain a better understanding of the development process as he works with developers on a day to day basis to ensure credentials are secured at rest. Also, he would like to apply some of the skills learned to help automate redundant tasks and to build security monitoring controls. He sees a lot of value in learning to code and is excited to build up some cool projects.</p>

      <p>His favorite color is red and favorite movie is the Town. Although he also really likes Batman: The Dark Knight. Outside of work he likes to play intramural sports such as flag football, beach volleyball and indoor soccer.</p>
